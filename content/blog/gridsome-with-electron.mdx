## Learn how to combine your knowledge of Gridsome for SPA and Electron for desktop apps to build a desktop app.

Electron and Gridsome was the basic requirement for an application i and my team
were working on so i started to make some research on how to use gridsome in
electron both in development and production with a smooth developer experience
but i couldn't find any article or video on building desktop applications with
electron and gridsome that is why i'm writing this article because I'm sure
someone might run into some issues i faced setting it up :).

### Prerequisites

1. Basic knowledge of Javascript
2. Must have Node installed on your machine.
3. Basic knowledge of Electron

### Project structure

## What is Gridsome?

Gridsome is a Vue-powered static site generator for building blazing fast static
websites. It is data-driven meaning it uses a GraphQL layer to get data from
different sources in order to dynamically generate pages from it. Gridsome is
the Vue alternative to Gatsby for React.js.

As this tutorial is not a beginners guide for gridsome, I'll not go into full
details of gridsome.

### Setting up Gridsome.

#### Installation.

Run the following command to install Gridsome globally in your computer:

```bash
yarn global add @gridsome/cli
 # or
npm install -g @gridsome/cli
```

Next step is to create a new project using the CLI we just installed:

```bash
gridsome create gridsome-electron-boilerplate
```

This command will bootstrap a new gridsome site for you and install all the
necessary dependencies.

Once that is done installing we can run the Gridsome site with this command:

```bash
cd gridsome-electron-boilerplate && gridsome develop
```

## Electron

Electron, managed by Github, is used in a myriad of
[projects + companies](https://electronjs.org/apps). Making your web apps
available for desktop makes them that much more versatile. So it makes sense to
have a fundamental understanding of Electron, and how to integrate it into
current projects.

### What is Electron?

Electron allows you to build cross-platform desktop applications, using a
Node.js backend and a Chromium front-end. It might seem like a challenge to turn
your Gridsome web-app into a full fledged, downloadable desktop app — but
Electron’s objective is to make this process seamless. I was intimidated at
first, but the learning curve wasn’t nearly what I thought it would be.

Basic structure of an electron app:

![Electron structure](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614292622/blog/electron-gridsome/electron-structure_n8amcn.png)

Install electron in your project by running:

```bash
yarn add -D electron@latest
```

You might have noticed that our base electron files are situated in a folder
called `electron` and I'm emphasizing on this because electron is not going to
work without making few changes to our `package.json` file. You need to point
the `main` in your `package.json` file to point to your electron `main.js`
fille.

After that, your package.json should look like this:

```json
{
	"name": "hardocs-electron-gridsome",
	"private": true,
	"main": "electron/main.js", // pointing to the main.js in electron folder
	"dependencies": {
		"@gridsome/source-filesystem": "^0.6.2",
		"gridsome": "^0.7.0",
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"electron": "^9.1.0",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

You can simply run the following commands to startup your electron app:

```bash
npx electron .
```

Now we need to load gridsome contents in our electron app. Add the following
lines of code to load gridsome url in your electron app:

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createWindow() {
  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
  });

  mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:8080');
}

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow();

  app.on('activate', function () {
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
  });
});

app.on('window-all-closed', function () {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') app.quit();
});
```

Before you start up your electron app you need to make sure your gridsome
website is running on `http://localhost:8080` then you can proceed to run this
command in your terminal:

```bash
npx electron .
```

![Electron with gridsome working perfectly](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614292624/blog/electron-gridsome/gridsome-electron_afdtcm.png)

Bravo 😁. Gridsome is working perfectly in electron.

It's clear that electron is loading gridsome pretty fine in development mode.
However, It's totally different in production mode because in production,
gridsome generates just `html, css and javascript` files.

Now lets get everything working in both development and production environments.

To do this, we need the help of this packages:

```bash
yarn add live-server
```

1. [Live-server](http://npmjs.com/package/live-server): Live server helps us to
   serve `html, css and javascript` files including folders with LIVE RELOAD.

Basically, what we're going to do is to conditionally load the
`build index.html` file from gridsome or load gridsome development server url.

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const path = require('path');
const liveServer = require('live-server');

const distDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'dist'); // require build directory
const host = 'localhost'; // host: localhost or 0.0.0.0
const port = 4000;
const url = 'http://' + host + ':' + port; // => http://localhost:8081
const params = {
  port: port,
  host: host,
  root: distDir,
  open: false, // prevents auto-open in browser
  file: 'index.html',
};

function createWindow() {
  const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
  });
  if (
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'prod' ||
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ) {
    // Here we check if we're in production env
    liveServer.start(params); // startup live-server
    mainWindow.loadURL(url); // load the url in gridsome
  } else {
    mainWindow.loadURL('http://localhost:8000');
  }
}

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow();

  app.on('activate', function () {
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
  });
});

app.on('window-all-closed', function () {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') app.quit();
});
```

From the code above, you can see that we're either loading the url we get from
live-server or the gridsome dev server url.

However, we need to build our gridsome application into static
`html, css and js` files and to do that we have to tweak our `package.json` a
little bit.

your final `package.json` file should look exactly like this:

```json
{
  "name": "hardocs-electron-gridsome",
  "private": true,
  "main": "electron/main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "gridsome build",
    "develop": "NODE_ENV=dev gridsome develop",
    "electron": "electron ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@gridsome/source-filesystem": "^0.6.2",
    "gridsome": "^0.7.0",
    "live-server": "^1.2.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^9.1.0"
  }
}
```

Now, run the build command to generate a `build` directory:

```bash
yarn build
```

We can now run yarn start our electron app by running:

```bash
yarn electron
```

However, you might run into issues when your `live-server` fails to start before
the electron app so we need some extra help to handle that part and also setup a
proper development experience.

```bash
yarn add wait-on
```

2. [wait-on](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on): wait-on - wait for files,
   ports, sockets, http(s) resources.

Finally, we need to do some shell scripting.

Create a `startServer.sh` file in your root directory and add the following
lines of code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your environment: " NODE_ENV

if [ "$NODE_ENV" = "production" ] || [ "$NODE_ENV" = "prod" ]
then
    echo $NODE_ENV;
    exec yarn prod;
else
    echo $NODE_ENV;
    exec yarn develop & yarn wait
fi
```

What the above code does is that it would prompt you to enter your environment
and if it matches `prod` or `production` then it would execute the first if
block else it would execute the else block.

Now add these scripts to your `package.json` and you're all set :

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
      "build": "gridsome build",
      "develop": "gridsome develop -p 8000",
      "explore": "gridsome explore",
      "prod": "NODE_ENV=production electron .",
      "wait": "wait-on http://localhost:8000 && electron .",
      "grant": "chmod +x ./startServer.sh",
      "start": "./startServer.sh"
  },
  ...
}
```

I'll focus on the `develop`, `prod`, `wait`, `grant` and `start` commands.

1. `develop`: I specified a port 8000 for the development mode of the gridsome
   server.
2. `prod`: assigns the NODE_ENV to `production`
3. `wait`: uses the `wait-on` package we installed earlier to wait for port 8000
   to be ready before executing the `electron .` command
4. `grant`: makes `startServer.sh` executable.
5. `start` command executes `startServer.sh` file.

make `startServer.sh` executable by running:

```bash
yarn grant
```

then startup your project smoothly with:

```bash
yarn start
```

It's open source so feel free to contribute.

### Conclusion:

To conclude, we were able to:

1. Setup gridsome
2. Setup electron
3. Work with electron and gridsome in development mode
4. Overcome some challenges that usually occur when gridsome is in production
   mode with the help of `wait-on` package and some shell scripts.
