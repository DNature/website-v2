## A reference guide on how to remove unused CSS selectors, Minify CSS files to reduce your website's loading time

Sometimes you wonder why your website takes a longer time üòû to completely load
content but takes shorter time on other websites. There are different
[**factors**](/blog/optimize-your-website-speed) that can cause this issue like
Image sizes and or file sizes.

## What are unused CSS?

When developing a website/application, we developers tend to use different CSS
frameworks with large file sizes and can really mess up our website loading
time. For example, frameworks like [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) come with dozens of CSS styles that you
probably do not need.

> **Unused CSS are _CSS selectors_ that are not implemented in your application
> and contributes to the growth of web page size**. Removing them is really
> going to improve our page performance.

Now you know what and why we should remove unused css so **Lets hit the ground
running üöÄ**.

## [Purge CSS](https://purgecss.com/)

![Purge CSS](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale/v1614290108/blog/unused_css/purgecss_uzjkck.webp)

This is one of the best tool i've come across while trying to remove _Unused
CSS_ and its very easy to implement into your existing application.

### üòÆ It has a CLI tool üî•

```bash
# to install it globally so that you can access the CLI run:
npm i -g purgecss
```

Open the project you want to include purgecss into and run the following command
in your terminal

```bash
purgecss --css style.css --content index.html
# if you dont have purgecss installed globally in
# your computer and you are using npm, run this command
npm purgecss --css style.css --content index.html
```

This command will collect the _style.css_ (indicated by `--css` )and
_index.html_ (indicated by `--content` ) and remove all unused CSS selectors in
them.

By default, the JavaScript API will look for _purgecss.config.js_ Add purgecss
as a development dependency into your project by running:

```bash
npm i -D purgecss
```

create a _purgecss.config.js_ file and input the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['**/*.html'],
  css: ['**/*.css'],
};
```

> The above code works for all _css_ and _html_ files in your workspace.

```bash
# ‚ö°Ô∏è run this command to remove all unused css selectors
npm run purgecss --config ./purgecss.config.js
```

## Summary

Now you know why some websites takes longer to load and removing unused css
selectors can improve the loading time. You're most likely to notice the changes
when using some frameworks like [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) and
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).
