## Learn how to automatically minify your files with gulpjs?.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/)

- Make sure [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed in your computer

<br />

## To start â€” what is gulp?

Gulp is a JavaScript task runner that lets you automate tasks such asâ€¦

- Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets.
- Refreshing your browser when you save a file.
- Quickly running unit tests.
- Running code analysis.
- And much more!

An alternative to Gulp is [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)

<br />

We can create tasks that we would like to fulfill. In these tasks we load files
that we want gulp to work on (modifying or not), then we return them to some
return folder.

<br />

Setting up Gulp is simple compared to Grunt.

<br />

In this little tutorial, I will teach you how to create a task to minify all CSS
files in your folder. Then put the minified ones in another folder.

<br />

## Letâ€™s start ðŸš€

Our project structure ðŸ‘‡

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”œâ”€â”€ gulpfile.js
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

First thing is to install [gulp-cli](https://gulpjs.com/) globally by running:

```bash
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

Next step is to initialize our project with npm by running:

```bash
npm init -y
```

> I'm using the _-y_ flag to skip all the prompts

We will create a **gulpfile.js** by running:

```bash
npx -p touch nodetouch gulpfile.js
```

There are tons of **open source plugins** for almost every task in the
[official gulpjs website](https://gulpjs.com/plugins/) however, we are going to
consider some plugins for

- [Minifying images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin/)
- [Uglify our CSS files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css/)
- [Uglify our JS files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify/)
- and much more...

First lets work on **Images.**

<br />

I am going to use an uncompressed version of my profile photo for this demo
which is about _1.4mb_ so that we can know how useful it is to compress our
images without loosing its quality and details.

<br />

The first step is to install the plugins we wish to use.

```bash
npm i -D gulp-imagemin
```

## In Gulpfile.js

Add the following code to the **gulpfile.js** file we created earlier.

```js
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');

function minifyImages() {
  return src(['./images/**/*']).pipe(imagemin()).pipe(dest('dist/images'));
}

exports.minifyImages = minifyImages;
```

First of all we **require** our **plugins** then we create a function and call
it **_minifyImages_**. This function return a **gulp task** that maps through
everything in our **/images** directory, then we call our **imagemin()**
function that we got from the plugin we imported. next we specify our output
directory in the **dest**(). Finally we export our function.

You might be wondering â€” youâ€™re already able to minify your files? Yes, by
executing the gulp command in the terminal followed by the task name.

<br />

We can view all available tasks we have written by executing the following
command:

```bash
gulp --tasks
```

<br />

![gulp tasks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale/v1614289770/blog/gulp/gulp-tasks_tcxptt.gif)

<br />

The only defined task in our gulpfile is the _**minifyImages**_ task so if we
execute

```bash
gulp minifyImages
```

It is going to create a new folder called **/dist/images** and put all our files
as we specified in the **dest.**

If you compare the size of our original image to the minified version you will
see a big difference because our minified image is **490kb** while our original
image is **1.40mb.** Thats awesome right?.

## Minify CSS files

The next thing we are going to checkout is how to minify **CSS** files?.

The steps are pretty much the same.

We will start off by installing **gulp-clean-css** plugin

```bash
npm i -D gulp-clean-css
```

Next we will require our plugin and add a function that will minify our **CSS**
files.

```js
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');
const cleancss = require('gulp-clean-css');

function minifyImages() {
  return src(['./images/**/*']).pipe(imagemin()).pipe(dest('dist/images'));
}

function minifyCss() {
  return src(['css/**/*.css']).pipe(cleancss()).pipe(dest('dist/css'));
}

exports.minifyCss = minifyCss;
exports.minifyImages = minifyImages;
```

Then we can minify our css files by running:

```bash
gulp minifyCss
```

To minify your javascript files your code should look like:

```js
const { src, dest } = require('gulp');
const imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');
const cleancss = require('gulp-clean-css');
const javascript = require('gulp-uglify');

function minifyImages() {
  return src(['./images/**/*']).pipe(imagemin()).pipe(dest('dist/images'));
}

function minifyCss() {
  return src(['css/**/*.css']).pipe(cleancss()).pipe(dest('dist/css'));
}

function minifyJS() {
  return src(['js/**/*.js']).pipe(javascript()).pipe(dest('dist/js'));
}

exports.minifyCss = minifyCss;
exports.minifyImages = minifyImages;
exports.minifyJS = minifyJS;
```

Gulp provides us with a method called **series() & parallel()**

## series()

- Combines task functions and/or composed operations into larger operations that
  will be executed one after another, in sequential order. There are no imposed
  limits on the nesting depth of composed operations using series() and
  parallel().

Lets enhance our DX by applying the series method.

<br />

Your code should look like:

```js
const { src, dest, task, series } = require('gulp');
const imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');
const cleancss = require('gulp-clean-css');
const javascript = require('gulp-uglify');

function minifyImages() {
  return src(['./images/**/*']).pipe(imagemin()).pipe(dest('dist/images'));
}

function minifyCss() {
  return src(['css/**/*.css']).pipe(cleancss()).pipe(dest('dist/css'));
}

function minifyJS() {
  return src(['js/**/*.js']).pipe(javascript()).pipe(dest('dist/js'));
}

exports.minifyCss = minifyCss;
exports.minifyImages = minifyImages;
exports.minifyJS = minifyJS;

task('start', series(minifyCss, minifyImages, minifyJS));
```

Now you can execute all your gulp tasks with one command

```bash
gulp start
```

## Conclusion

This is just a small way that gulp can help us in the development of our
applications.
