## A comprehensive guide on how to upload files with Apollo-server 2.0 and Mongodb.

### Prerequisites

- [Altair](https://altair.sirmuel.design/) (Recommended alternative to the
  default graphql playground)

- You must have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.

- Basic knowledge of **nodejs**

File Uploads have an interesting history in the Apollo ecosystem.

<br />

With Apollo Server 2.0, you can perform file uploads right out of the box.
Apollo Server ships with the ability to handle multipart requests that contain
file data. This means you can send a mutation to Apollo Server containing a
file, pipe it to the filesystem, or pipe it to a cloud storage provider instead.

<br />

Depending on your problem domain and your use case, the way you set up file
uploads may differ. Handling Multipart upload request in graphql can be a pain
in the ass especially when your are coming from a **Rest** background like me.
However, I'm going to show you how to upload files with **apollo-server 2.0 **

<br />

One of the simplest ways of achieving file uploads in a single request is to
base64-encode a file and send as a string variable in a mutation.

## How it works

The upload functionality follows the GraphQL multipart form requests
specification. Two parts are needed to make the upload work correctly. The
server and the client:

- **The Client:** On the client, file objects are mapped into a mutation and
  sent to the server in a multipart request.

- **The Server:** The multipart request is received. The server processes it and
  provides an upload argument to a resolver. In the resolver function, the
  upload promise resolves an object.

## Our project structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 9A1ufNLv-bg-works.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ db.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ fileModel.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ resolvers.js
    â””â”€â”€ typeDefs.js
```

<br />

## Lets Begin ðŸš€

We will start off by initializing our project with npm, install the necessary
packages and configure our server.

<br />

```bash
npm init -y

yarn add esm apollo-server graphql mongoose shortid

yarn add -D nodemon
```

<br />

I'm going to explain what each package will handle shortly.

The next step is to setup our server with apollo and mongoose. Create a
**db.js** file in your **/src** directory and add the following configuration
code to connect to your **mongodb** database:

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
const MONGO_CONNECTION = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/fileUploads';

export default (async function connect() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(MONGO_CONNECTION, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

<br />

Now create an **index.js** file in your **/src** directory and paste the
following code start off your server on
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000):

```js
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';
import typeDefs from './typeDefs';
import resolvers from './resolvers';

// Import your database configuration
import connect from './db';

export default (async function () {
  try {
    await connect.then(() => {
      console.log('Connected ðŸš€ To MongoDB Successfully');
    });

    const server = new ApolloServer({
      typeDefs,
      resolvers,
    });

    server.listen(4000, () => {
      console.log(`ðŸš€ server running @ http://localhost:4000`);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

<br />

Next we'll create our **resolvers** and **typeDefs** and put it in a separate
file:

```js
import { gql } from 'apollo-server';

export default gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;
```

```js
export default {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world',
  },
};
```

Lol ðŸ˜… thats just a simple **Hello world** Query.

<br />

Now add a **dev** script to your **package.json** file to enable us start up our
server.

You may be wondering why we've been using **ES6** syntax without configuring
babel and thats because of the
**[esm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm)** we installed earlier.

<br />

> **esm** is the worldâ€™s most advanced ECMAScript module loader. This fast,
> production ready, zero dependency loader is all you need to support ECMAScript
> modules in Node 6+.

```json
{
  "name": "apollo-upload",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon -r esm src/index.js" /* we are requiring the esm module 
    with [-r] flag to transpile our es6 code */
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "apollo-server": "^2.11.0",
    "graphql": "^14.6.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.9.4",
    "esm": "^3.2.25",
    "shortid": "^2.2.15"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.2"
  }
}
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

<br />

![yarn start](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614280911/blog/file-uploads-apollo/start-server_uiye6g.png)

<br />

We can see that out server is running on **localhost:4000**. Let's test our
**Hello world** query in out graphql playground.

<br />

![Hello query](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614280913/blog/file-uploads-apollo/hello_wse2ae.png)

<br />

For server integrations that support file uploads (e.g. Express, hapi, Koa),
Apollo Server enables file uploads by default. To enable file uploads reference
the **Upload** type in the schema passed to the Apollo Server construction.

<br />

Now your **typeDefs** file should look exactly like this:

```js
import { gql } from 'apollo-server';

export default gql`
  type File {
    id: ID!
    filename: String!
    mimetype: String!
    path: String!
  }

  type Query {
    hello: String
    files: [File!]
  }

  type Mutation {
    uploadFile(file: Upload!): File
  }
`;
```

> Note: When using typeDefs, Apollo Server adds scalar Upload to your schema, so
> any existing declaration of scalar Upload in the type definitions should be
> removed. If you create your schema with makeExecutableSchema and pass it to
> ApolloServer constructor using the schema param, make sure to include scalar
> Upload.

<br />

The server is going to return a rpomise that resolves an object. The object
contains the following:

1. **createReadStream:** The upload stram manages straming the file(s) to a
   filesystemor any storage location of your choice.

2. **filename:** The original name of the uploaded file(s)

3. **mimetype:** The MIME type of the file(s) such as _image/jpg_,
   _application/json_, etc.

4. **encoding:** The file encoding i.e _UTF-8_

<br />

Now we are going to create a function that will process our file and pipe it
into a directory.

```js
import shortid from 'shortid';
import { createWriteStream, mkdir } from 'fs';

import File from './fileModel';

const storeUpload = async ({ stream, filename, mimetype }) => {
  const id = shortid.generate();
  const path = `images/${id}-${filename}`;

  // (createWriteStream) writes our file to the images directory
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    stream
      .pipe(createWriteStream(path))
      .on('finish', () => resolve({ id, path, filename, mimetype }))
      .on('error', reject),
  );
};

const processUpload = async (upload) => {
  const { createReadStream, filename, mimetype } = await upload;
  const stream = createReadStream();
  const file = await storeUpload({ stream, filename, mimetype });
  return file;
};

export default {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world',
  },
  Mutation: {
    uploadFile: async (_, { file }) => {
      // Creates an images folder in the root directory
      mkdir('images', { recursive: true }, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
      });
      // Process upload
      const upload = await processUpload(file);
      return upload;
    },
  },
};
```

<br />

For the demo below i'm going to use **Altair** which is a graphql playground and
it's very efficient for file uploads.

## Saving to database(mongodb)

We used **file system** to handle our file uploads because of the following
reasons:

- **Performance can be better than when you do it in a database**. To justify
  this, if you store large files in DB, then it may slow down the performance
  because a simple query to retrieve the list of files or filename will also
  load the file data if you used Select \* in your query. In a file system,
  accessing a file is quite simple and light weight.

- **Saving the files and downloading them in the file system is much simpler**
  than it is in a database since a simple "Save As" function will help you out.
  Downloading can be done by addressing a URL with the location of the saved
  file.

- **Migrating the data is an easy process**. You can just copy and paste the
  folder to your desired destination while ensuring that write permissions are
  provided to your destination. ...

In the future i'm going to show you how to query the files from our **images**
directory through the file path specified in the database.

<br />

We are going to create our database **schema** and save it in a
**src/fileModel.js** file.

Your code should look like:

```js
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

const fileSchema = new Schema({
  filename: String,
  mimetype: String,
  path: String,
});

export default model('File', fileSchema);
```

<br />

Next step is to make use our **file schema**.

Your **src/resolvers.js** code should look like this:

```js
import shortid from 'shortid';
import { createWriteStream, mkdir } from 'fs';

// import our model
import File from './fileModel';

const storeUpload = async ({ stream, filename, mimetype }) => {
  const id = shortid.generate();
  const path = `images/${id}-${filename}`;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    stream
      .pipe(createWriteStream(path))
      .on('finish', () => resolve({ id, path, filename, mimetype }))
      .on('error', reject),
  );
};

const processUpload = async (upload) => {
  const { createReadStream, filename, mimetype } = await upload;
  const stream = createReadStream();
  const file = await storeUpload({ stream, filename, mimetype });
  return file;
};

export default {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world',
  },
  Mutation: {
    uploadFile: async (_, { file }) => {
      mkdir('images', { recursive: true }, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
      });

      const upload = await processUpload(file);
      // save our file to the mongodb
      await File.create(upload);
      return upload;
    },
  },
};
```
