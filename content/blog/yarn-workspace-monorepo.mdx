## How to setup Yarn workspace for React web, and React-Native(expo) with Typescript

<br />

### Prerequisites

- You must have **Typescript** installed on your system and some basic knowledge
  of it.

- Basic knowledge of **React** and **React Native**

Recently i started working on a Full stack Airbnb clone project from
[@benawad on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuswGIH-Xj8&list=PLN3n1USn4xlnfJIQBa6bBjjiECnk6zL6s)
that consists of a _Nodejs + Graphql server_, _React_, and _React Native_ but i
couldn't get it to work because of the resent changes in package versions.

<br />

## [Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/#toc-why-would-you-want-to-do-this)

> _Workspaces are a new way to setup your package architecture that‚Äôs available
> by default starting from Yarn 1.0. It allows you to setup multiple packages in
> such a way that you only need to run yarn install once to install all of them
> in a single pass_.
>
> Your dependencies can be linked together, which means that your workspaces can
> depend on one another while always using the most up-to-date code available.
> This is also a better mechanism than yarn link since it only affects your
> workspace tree rather than your whole system.

<br />

## Our repo structure

- **Yarn** handles the dependencies.

- One folder per package inside packages directory.

- All packages share the same structure.

- Each package defines only its runtime dependencies.

- All the tooling, dependencies and devDependencies are shared and live in its
  own package.

- Each package contains the required configuration files for the tooling. Each
  file extends a common base configuration (we use Babel, Jest and ESlint +
  Prettier to compile, test and lint/prettify the code).

- Each package symlinks a common task script that defines how the different
  tools must be invoked.

- There is a ‚Äúhub‚Äù package. It depends on all the other packages and allows easy
  usage of the framework (a single awesome dependency).

- All packages share the version number.

- Publication is handled by a custom publish script that will be used by the CI
  environment.

Let‚Äôs see each part in greater detail.

<br />

## Monorepo base: Yarn

The base **package.json** file looks like:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "name": "expo-yarn-workspace-demo"
}
```

- **workspaces** an array of directories

- The build script tells lerna to run all the build commands in our
  **/packages** directory.

<br />

## [Expo with Typescript](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/typescript/)

We will initialize our **EXPO** by running the following commands.

```bash
# Install the command line tools
npm install --global expo-cli
cd packages
expo init app
```

Use your arrow key to select **blank (Typescript)** for a typescript project and
complete the steps you're prompted with.

<br />

![expo init app](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale/v1614290825/blog/yarn-workspace/expo-init_ojzlux.png)

<br />

If you follow the above steps correctly its going to create an **/packages/app**
folder in the packages directory and install all the necessary dependencies.

> If you run into issues while generating your **expo** boilerplate then try to
> generate it in a folder and move it into your **/packages** folder.

<br />

## [React with Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/#installation)

Now we are going to generate our React-typescript boilerplate by running the
following commands:

```bash
yarn create react-app web --template typescript
```

The above command will generate a typescript boilerplate of react and install
all the necessary dependencies.

If you startup your expo project by running `yarn start` your app is going to
crash because yarn is **hoisting** some expo packages which we can prevent by
telling yarn not to do so.
[Read more about yarn workspace hoisting](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/).

Add the following piece of code in the root **package.json** file.

```json {2,5}
// package.json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "name": "expo-yarn-workspace-demo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "lerna run build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "^3.20.2"
  },
  "nohoist": [
    "**/react-native",
    "**/react-native/**",
    "**/expo",
    "**/expo/**",
    "**/@babel/core",
    "**/@babel/core/**"
  ]
}
```

<br />

The root **tsconfig.json** should look like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "ES2015",
      "dom.iterable",
      "ES6",
      "ES2017",
      "ESNext.AsyncIterable",
      "ESNext"
    ],
    "sourceMap": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  }
}
```

<br />

Your **packages/web/tsconfig.json** file should look like:

```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

<br />

Your **packages/app/tsconfig.json** file should look like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "jsx": "react-native",
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  }
}
```

<br />

Next thing is to configure babel in our **packages/app** folder.

create a file in your **packages/app** and call it `babel.config.js` and add the
following piece of code:

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  };
};
```

The **babel-preset-expo** plugin extends the default React Native preset
(metro-react-native-babel-preset) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking
web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if
they're installed.

Create a **metro.config.js** file in your **packages/app** directory and paste
the following configuration:

```js
const { createMetroConfiguration } = require('expo-yarn-workspaces');
module.exports = createMetroConfiguration(__dirname);
```

<br />

üöÄ Now you can run `yarn start` in your packages/app folder or packages/web and
everything will work fine.

- One great thing about _yarn workspaces_ is we can create a local package and
  share it across our **web, app** or even a custom folder (server)

Let me show you how it works with **Typescript**.

Create a folder in your **packages** directory and call it **common** then
create a **package.json** file with the default setup by running:

```bash
npm init -y
```

your **packages/common/package.json** file should look like:

```json
{
  "name": "@expoYarn/common",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "typings": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^10.3.2",
    "typescript": "^2.9.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "build:watch": "tsc --watch"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

> Note the **name** property is set to **@expoYarn/common** where **common** is
> the name of this current package.

Next create in the **common** directory and call it **src/**

<br />

We are going to add a simple code snippet that is going to be accessible across
our application.

Create a file in the **src** directory, call it **index.ts** then paste the
following code that accepts two parameters which are numbers and returns a sum
of the two numbers:

```js
export const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
```

We are going to build our project by running `tsc` in our common directory to
build our code into a dist folder.

<br />

To be able to access this module in our **web** directory we are going to add it
manually to our our **package.json** int the **web** directory:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@expoYarn/common": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

run `yarn install` to link the newly added package then we will test it out by
using it in our **App.tsx** to log the sum of two numbers. Your **App.tsx**
should look like:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import { add } from '@expoYarn/common';
import './App.css';

const App = () => {
  // Testing out our add function
  const result = add(10, 20);
  console.log(result); // => Returns [30]

  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <header className='App-header'>
        <img src={logo} className='App-logo' alt='logo' />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className='App-link'
          href='https://reactjs.org'
          target='_blank'
          rel='noopener noreferrer'
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

You can now see how handy **yarn workspaces** can be because it saves allot of
code which means we are following the **Don't Repeat Your Self (DRY)** principle
of **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** although there was allot of setup but
**_No Pain No Gain_**.
