A guide on creating or converting your react application into a progressive web
app.

<br />

## What is a Progressive Web Application (PWA)

> _A progressive web app (PWA) is the set of mobile web application development
> techniques that entails building apps that feel and look like native ones._
> Using a web stack (JS, HTML, and CSS), progressive web apps combine a rich
> functionality and smooth user experience associated with native apps. Simply
> put, PWA is the web app with the native-app flavor: After the installation, a
> user clicks on its icon on a device home screen and gets straight to the
> website.

<br />

Progressive web apps provides huge benefits like:

- **Self-updates:** Able to update themselves automatically, apps stay fresh.

- **Cross platform compatibility:** These apps are built according to
  progressive enhancement principles. Progressive enhancement is the web design
  strategy of providing the basic functionality and content to everyone
  regardless of browsers they use or connection quality while delivering more
  sophisticated page versions to users whose newer browsers can support them.

- **App-like experience:** It provides the feels and looks of a native mobile
  application.

- **Offline Support:** Your application can work offline except the page
  requires a real time data fetching.

## Service Workers

A service worker is a specific type of JavaScript worker, which is a script that
runs in the _background of the userâ€™s browser_. That way we are able to do allot
of things in the _background_ like caching static contents of our
website(Images, Css files, Html files, Videos, JS files ...) etc.

## ðŸš€ Lets get started ðŸ”¥

<br />

Since we are going to use React we need to initialize our project with
_create-react-app cli tool_.

```bash
yarn create react-app react-pwa
            # OR
npx create-react-app react-pwa
```

Next we will change directory into our working project folder by running
`cd react-pwa` in the terminal and I'm going to open the project on _VS Code_
using the `code .` command.

<br />

<br />

As you can see there's a bunch of files and folders that _create-react-app_
comes with but i am not going to go through everything in this tutorial.

<br />

There is an important file called _manifest.json_ in the _/public_ directory
which contains information(metadata) that defines your applications appearance
in different devices.

<br />

![Manifest file for Project](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614288198/blog/react-pwa/manifest_z0gaac.png)

<br />

- **short_name**: The name of your app when added to your home screen.

- **name**: The name that the browser uses to prompt users to add your app to
  their home scree.

- **icons**: Specifies icons that will be displayed in different devices
  including the web browser.

- **start_url**: The base path of your app when initialized.

- **display**: Here you can customize the browser view. Other options are
  _"fullscreen","standalone","minimal-ui","browser"_

- **theme_color**: The color of the browser toolbar

- **background_color**: The color of the splash screen that shows when the app
  is launched by clicking on its icon in the Home screen.

In the public/index.html

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
```

Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above. It will be replaced with the
URL of the public folder during the build. Only files inside the public folder
can be referenced from the HTML.

Lets play around with this app by adding some piece of code in our _src/App.js_
file.

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <header className='App-header'>
        <img src={logo} className='App-logo' alt='logo' />
        <h1>{value}</h1>
        <button
          style={{ padding: 12, backgroundColor: '#61dafb', border: 'none' }}
          onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}
        >
          Add 1
        </button>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Next we are going to build our app by running

```bash
npm run build
    #OR
yarn build
```

> Note: we are able to use this command because its present in our
> _package.json_ file.

The build script generates some files and stores it in a _build_ directory.

<br />

![Build folder](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614288198/blog/react-pwa/build_fe2mkk.png)

<br />

The static folder holds all the js and css files. The _index.html_ is our main
page that loads all our React files stored in the _static/js_ folder and also
our CSS that is stored in the _static/css_ folder. We can the
_service-worker.js_ file, thatâ€™s where all service worker code is stored. The
_precache-manifest.\*.js_ file holds all the files the service worker caches in
an array. We see the manifest.json file, as we already know it tells the browser
how our _PWA_ will behave.

We need to install a http-server to be able to run our app in the browser so i'm
going to install live-server by running:

```bash
npm install --global live-server
```

After installing _live-server_ we can add a script in our package.json to start
our server.

```json
"scripts": {
    ...
    "serve": "live-server ./build"
}

```

Now run `npm run serve` in your terminal and navigate to
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/?target=_blank) in your browser.

<br />

<br />

### ðŸ˜Ž Our app is live.

ðŸ’© However, If our server goes down at this point our application is going to
fail because its not _PWA_. There are many tools for testing _PWA_ but we are
going to use the built in tool that comes with Google Chrome.

<br />

If you press `F12` on your keyboard to open the chrome dev tools and navigate to
the application tab you can see that the _service-worker.js_ file is missing and
that is because we didn't register it in our application before build

To register it we just need to make one little change in our _src/index.js_.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.register();
```

> Note: we changed _~~serviceWorker.unregister()~~_ to serviceWorker.register().
> These are built in functions that comes with CRA.

Next we will build and serve our project by running

```bash
npm run build && npm run serve
```

and when you reload your browser you can see the _service-worker.js_ file in the
application tab of your console.

> Also note that the browser cached our static files in the CacheStorage

<br />

![Cached files](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614288198/blog/react-pwa/cache_wik9tw.png)

<br />

To test if our application is now a PWA we shutdown our server by holding
`ctrl + c` in the terminal then Refresh the browser and everything still works
the same way and no errors even though our server is down.
