## Learn how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a Couchdb database through a Graphql API.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of typescript & javascriptt
- Basic knowledge of graphql
- Good understanding of Nodejs
- Knowledge of couchdb is an advantage
- You must have Nodejs installed on your computer
- You must have couchdb installed on your computer
  [https://couchdb.apache.org/](https://couchdb.apache.org/)

### CouchDB

CouchDB falls under the document-oriented database in the NoSQL landscape and it
is known for its ease of use and scalable architecture. It is highly available
and partition tolerant but is also eventually consistent. Thus, it is an AP
based system according to CAP (Consistency, Availability, and Partition
Tolerance) theorem for distribute database systems.

> **Note**: This write-up doesnâ€™t discuss the suitability of the CouchDB to
> various use-cases, rather emphasizes on connecting to the database and
> interacting with it by performing CRUD operations through a Graphql API.

### Architecture

CouchDB organizes data into multiple databases. A database is a collection of
documents, and each document is a **JSON object**. As CouchDB stores data in the
form of JSON documents, it is schema-less and highly flexible.

Each document in a database contains a bare minimum of two fields: **\_id**
which represents unique identity of the document, and **\_rev** which represents
the revision number of the document. If the document posted while document
creation doesnâ€™t have **\_id** attribute, CouchDB generates one and saves the
document. On the other hand, **\_rev** is used to resolve document update
conflict. If two clients tries to update the same document, the first update
wins and the second one has to get the update from first client before itâ€™s
update.

### Creating a database

CouchDB installation come up with a web administration console and can be
accessible from [http://localhost:5984/\_utils](http://localhost:5984/_utils).
This page lists all the databases available in the running CouchDB instance.

Click of the **Create Database** to manually create a database.

**Nano** is a greate tool for communicating with our CouchDB database, However,
It has one of the most terrible documentaions expecially when it commes to
**Typescript**.

Without further ado, Lets get into the coding part ðŸš€.

The first step is to install all the necessary dependencies. I'll be using
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) throughout this tutorial.

```bash
yarn add graphql-yoga nano dotenv;
```

- graphql-yoga: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup,
  performance & great developer experience
- dotenv: Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables
  from a .env file into process.env.
- nano: Official Apache CouchDB library for Node.js.

**Dev Dependencies**

```bash
yarn add -D typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon
```

### Our project structure

```
â””â”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ dbConnection
        â””â”€â”€ couch.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ resolvers.js
    â””â”€â”€ typeDefs.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ .env
```

### Code walkthrough

This section describes the application code in a bottom-up fashion.

### 1: Setting up Graphql Server

Your `src/index.ts` should look like:

```ts
require('dotenv').config(); // For environment variables
import { GraphQLServer } from 'graphql-yoga';
import { Server } from 'http';
import { Server as HTTPSServer } from 'https';

import typeDefs from './typeDefs'; // we are going to create this in a minute
import resolvers from './resolvers'; // we are going to create this in a minute

export default (async (): Promise<Server | HTTPSServer> => {
  const server = new GraphQLServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  });

  const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;
  return await server.start(
    {
      port,
    },
    () => console.log(`server is running on http://localhost:${port}`),
  );
})();
```

#### 2: Creating an instance of Nano

Add the following snippet to your `./dbConnection/couch.ts` file:

```ts
import * as Nano from 'nano';

export default (async () => {
  const dbName = 'hello';
  const nano = Nano(process.env.DB_HOST_AUTH); // I'll be storing the database connection uri
  // in an environment variable since it contains vital credentials.

  const dbList = await nano.db.list(); // Returns a list of database

  try {
    if (!dbList.includes(dbName)) {
      // create a new DB if database doesn't exist.
      await nano.db.create(dbName);
      const db = nano.use(dbName);
      console.log('database created successfully');
      return db;
    } else {
      const db = nano.use(dbName);
      console.log('connected to database successfully');
      return db;
    }
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(err);
  }
})();
```

The above code snippet first retrieves all the database names in our couchDB
then checks if it includes a the database we want to use and then uses it with
the `nano.use(dbName)` function. If it doesn't include the our database name we
want to use then it will automatically create a new database with the given
name.

`Nano(process.env.DB_HOST_AUTH)` receives a connection string which varies
depending on wether we require authentication or not.

- `http://username:password@localhost:5984` includes credentials thus stored in
  the `.env` file as `DB_HOST_AUTH=http://username:password@localhost:5984`
- `http://localhost:5984` does not include any credentials and can be used
  directly.

#### 3: Graphql Type Definitions

Add the following code to your `src/typeDefs.ts` file:

```ts
export default `
  type Doc {
    name: String!
    email: String!
    age: Int!
    nice: Boolean!
    updated: Boolean
  }

   type Mutation {
    createRecord(name: String!, email: String!, age: Int!, nice: Boolean!): Boolean!
    delete(id: String, rev: String): Boolean!
    update(id: String, rev: String, updated: Boolean): Boolean!
  }
  
  type Query {
    findAll: [Doc!]
    findSingle(id: String!): Doc!
  }
`;
```

> I won't go in detail on how graphql works like in Mutations and Queries as
> this is not a Beginners Graphql guide.

#### 4: Resolvers.

Resolvers are per field functions that are given a parent object, arguments, and
the execution context, and are responsible for returning a result for that
field. Resolvers cannot be included in the GraphQL schema language, so they must
be added separately. The collection of resolvers is called the "resolver map".
It mostly consist of Queries and Mutations.

#### Mutations

##### 4a: Creating a record - `nano.insert()`.

The first operation in CRUD is Create. `nano.insert()` is used to both insert
and update the document. This function takes either an object or a string as an
argument and inserts/updates the document given.

```ts
import { MaybeDocument } from 'nano';
import couch from './dbConnection/couch';

// Lets define the interfaces for each resolver.
interface User extends MaybeDocument {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
  nice: boolean;
}

interface Update extends MaybeDocument {
  updated: boolean;
  id: string;
  rev: string;
}

export default {
  Mutation: {
    createRecord: async (_parent: any, args: User) => {
      try {
        const record = await (await couch).insert(args);

        console.log(record);
        return true;
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return false;
      }
    },
  },
};
```

<br />

##### 4b: Update a record - `nano.insert(id, rev)`.

As stated earlier, `nano.insert()` is used to both insert and update the
document. When this function has given a document with both `_id` and `_rev,`
this function performs an update. If the `_rev` given in the document is
obsolete, update fails and the client is expected to get the latest revision of
the document before performing any further updates

Below code demonstrates retrieving a blog by itâ€™s id.

```ts
...

export default {
  Mutation: {
    update: async (_: any, { id, rev, ...args }: Update) => {
        const findFile = await (await couch).get(id);
        if (findFile) {
            const file = await (await couch).insert({
                _id: id,
                _rev: rev,
                ...findFile,
                ...args,
            });
            console.log(file);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    },
    ...
  },
};
```

![Update a record](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614605075/blog/graphql-crud/update_hj275a.png)

<br />

##### 4c: Delete record - `nano.destroy(id, rev).

`nano.destroy(id, rev, [callback])` is used delete a document from database.
Underneath method deletes a blog entry given itâ€™s `_id` and `_rev`

The **Nano** delete function requires a document **\_id** and a **\_rev**

Below code demonstrates deletion of a record by its id and rev.

```ts
...

export default {
  Mutation: {
    delete: async (_: any, { id, rev }: { id: string; rev: string }) => {
        const record = await (await couch).destroy(id, rev);
        console.log(record);
        return true;
    },
    ...
  },
};

```

<br />

##### 4d 1: Retrieve a record by id - `nano.get(id).

`nano.get(id, [params], [callback])` is used to get the document by its id.
Underneath method in BlogService class gets the blog given its id.

Below code demonstrates retrieving a document by itâ€™s id.

```ts
...

export default {
  Query: {
    findSingle: async (_: any, { id }: { id: string }) => {
        const file = await (await couch).get(id);
        console.log(file);
        return file;
    },
    ...
  },
};

```

![Retrieve a record](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614605075/blog/graphql-crud/findSingle_lp07wq.png)

<br />

##### 4d 2: Retrieve multiple files - `nano.find(selector).

`nano.find(selector, [callback])` performs a _"Mango" query_ by supplying a
JavaScript object containing a selector: the `fields` option can be used to
retrieve specific fields.

Below code demonstrates how to retrieve documents from couchdb.

```ts
...

export default {
  Query: {
    findAll: async () => {
        const files = await (await couch).find({
            selector: {}, // parameters can be added to query specific documents.
            fields: ['name', 'email', 'age', 'nice', 'updated'],
        });
        console.log(files.docs);
        return files.docs;
    },
    ...
  },
};

```

![Retrieve multiple records](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614605075/blog/graphql-crud/findAll_ce1b7y.png)

<br />
<br />

Your final `resolvers.ts` file should not be different from the below code:

```ts
import { MaybeDocument } from 'nano';

import couch from './dbConnection/couch';

interface User extends MaybeDocument {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
  nice: boolean;
}

interface Update extends MaybeDocument {
  updated: boolean;
  id: string;
  rev: string;
}

export default {
  Mutation: {
    createRecord: async (_parent: any, args: User) => {
      try {
        const record = await (await couch).insert(args);

        console.log(record);
        return true;
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return false;
      }
    },

    delete: async (_: any, { id, rev }: { id: string; rev: string }) => {
      const record = await (await couch).destroy(id, rev);
      console.log(record);
      return true;
    },

    update: async (_: any, { id, rev, ...args }: Update) => {
      const findFile = await (await couch).get(id);
      if (findFile) {
        const file = await (await couch).insert({
          _id: id,
          _rev: rev,
          ...findFile,
          ...args,
        });
        console.log(file);
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    },
  },
  Query: {
    findAll: async () => {
      const files = await (await couch).find({
        selector: {},
        fields: ['name', 'email', 'age', 'nice', 'updated'],
      });
      console.log(files.docs);
      return files.docs;
    },

    findSingle: async (_: any, { id }: { id: string }) => {
      const file = await (await couch).get(id);
      console.log(file);
      return file;
    },
  },
};
```
