**Netlify** is a static page provider with Git deploy integration opportunity
(GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) . Netlify has got very good performance, it provides
https certification and we can use our own domain with the projects. So, we have
got everything that we need for a starter project. Here comes a brief guide!

<br />

On the other hand [**Nextjs**](https://nextjs.org) is a
[Reactjs](https://reactjs.org) framework that provides **Server Side Rendering
SSR** applications which means with Nextjs we can export our full application by
pages so it behaves as a server-side rendered application without a server
(Nodejs, PHP etc).

<br />

You just need to add few scripts in your **package.json** file:

```json
{
   ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "start": "next start",

    "build": "next build",
    "export": "next export", ðŸ˜ƒ
    "deploy": "npm run build && npm run export" ðŸš€
  }
}
```

The **build** script builds our project and saves it in a directory called
**.next**. The **export** command exports all our files inside the **.next**
directory into plain **html, css and javascript** files and the deploy script
runs both the **build** and **export** script one at a time.

<br />

The next thing is to deploy your project to git and i'm going to use github for
this tutorial.

The project i am using is from
[an article i wrote earlier](/blog/how-to-setup-tailwind-purgecss-and-nextjs)

- Code:
  [https://github.com/dnature/hello-next](https://github.com/dnature/hello-next)

<br />

[First create an account with netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/signup?_ga=2.58798317.1351806053.1583669087-991025437.1583669087)

Next Click on [New site from git](https://app.netlify.com/start)

<br />

<br />

Next step is to select Github and select your github repository you wish to
deploy.

Next step is to select the git branch you wish to deploy. the default is
_master_.

> **Note**: I created a new branch(_deploy_) for the purpose of this tutorial so
> i am going to select that branch instead of using the default **master**
> branch.

In the build command input field we have to tell netlify to run our deploy
script by passing:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

<br />

Our output directory is the default _out_ folder that nextjs provides when we
run `npm run export`

<br />

<br />

That's all! After these settings, Netlify will take care about hosting and build
process on your selected branch.

<br />

## Conclusion

Netlify is a very fantastic service for static sites but now we have learnt how
to also deploy **server side rendered applications.**
