## A complete guide on how to upload files to graphql server with react and apollo-upload-client.

**_Bonus: _ You will also learn how to serve files from your apollo server with
express.**

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of React
- Basic knowledge of Apollo
- Graphql API with file upload capabilities
  ([Here is a complete guide on how to create Upload files on apollo-server](/blog/file-uploads-with-apolloserver-2))

Here is a demo of what we are going to build.
![Complete example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale/v1614284287/blog/file-upload-react/completed_mlxdkn.gif)

### Let's get started 🚀

First we are going to use the `create-react-app` cli to bootstrap a new react
project by running:

```bash
npx create-react-app react-apollo-upload
    # or
yarn create react-app react-apollo-upload

# Change directory into react-apollo-upload by running
cd react-apollo-upload
```

Open the project in your favourite editor/IDE. I'll be using vs-code which is my
favourite editor.

We are going to install all the required packages for now then i'll explain the
function of each package.

```bash
npm install graphql graphql-tag apollo-upload-client @apollo/react-hooks apollo-cache-inmemory react-dropzone
```

Next thing is to setup our react application to be able use apollo-upload-client
so we are going to make few changes to our `src/index.js` to look like:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';

import App from './App.jsx';
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';
import { createUploadLink } from 'apollo-upload-client';
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/react-hooks';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';

const httpLink = createUploadLink({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000',
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

The traditional apollo-client react application uses _apollo-link-http_.

> [Apollo-link-http](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/http/) is a
> terminating link that fetches GraphQL results from a GraphQL endpoint over an
> http connection. The http link supports both POST and GET requests with the
> ability to change the http options on a per query basis. This can be used for
> authentication, persisted queries, dynamic uris, and other granular updates.

However, **apollo-link-http** doesn't support file uploads thats we we are going
to use **apollo-upload-client**.

We created our **upload link** and stored it in a variable called httpLink then
we used the link as an option in the **ApolloClient** option. we also added
**apollo-cache-inmemory** for caching. then we wrap our `<App/>` component with
ApolloProvider and pass in the client prop and now our entire application has
access to the apollo client we created.

For the purpose of code readability we are going to split our code into
different components and they're going to live in the _src/components_
directory.

Create an _upload.jsx_ file in your _src/components_ and add the following code
which i will explain to you in a sec.

```js
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';

const FileUpload = () => {
  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles) => {
    // do something here
    console.log(acceptedFiles);
  }, []);
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div
        {...getRootProps()}
        className={`dropzone ${isDragActive && 'isActive'}`}
      >
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {isDragActive ? (
          <p>Drop the files here ...</p>
        ) : (
          <p>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
export default FileUpload;
```

In the above code, we imported useCallback hook from **react** and useDropzone
hook form **react-dropzone**. Next we destructured _getRootProps, getInputProps,
and isDragActive_ from useDropzone and we passed an onDrop callback as an
option.

The **useDropzone** hook contains a lot of props which you can learn more about
in there official github repo
[https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/)

Next we spread _...getRootProps()_ in our wrapper div and _...getInputProps()_
in the default** html input **element and react-dropzone will handle the rest
for us.

We can perform a lot of operations in the **onDrop** callback. However, I'm just
going to console.log the file for now to see what it looks like.

To test this out we need to import our component into the App.js component so
your **src/App.js** should look like

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import FileUpload from './components/upload';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <header className='App-header'>
        <img src={logo} className='App-logo' alt='logo' />
        <h1>Upload files effortlessly</h1>
      </header>
      <div className='container'>
        <FileUpload />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

![Log files](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614284199/blog/file-upload-react/log-files_v8p1rz.png)

As we can see from the image above we get an array of files from
_react-dropzone_. However, we only care about a single file because our server
is currently configured to only accept a single file so we are going to use the
first file by accessing its index which is at **0**.

We are going to create our mutation and the **graphql-tag** package we installed
enables us to do that.

```graphql
...

import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const UploadMutation = gql`
  mutation uploadFile($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) {
      path
      id
      filename
      mimetype
    }
  }
`;

...
```

First we imported **gql** from graphql-tag then we create our Upload mutation
which has a parameter **file** (in graphql, variables are written with a dollar
sign prefix followed by the name) and its value is a graphql scaler type
**Upload.**

```js
...
// import usemutation hook from @pollo/react-hooks
import { useMutation } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

...

// pass in the UploadMutation mutation we created earlier.
const [uploadFile] = useMutation(UploadMutation);

  const onDrop = useCallback(
    (acceptedFiles) => {
      // select the first file from the Array of files
      const file = acceptedFiles[0];
      // use the uploadFile variable created earlier
      uploadFile({
        // use the variables option so that you can pass in the file we got above
        variables: { file },
        onCompleted: () => {},
      });
    },
    // pass in uploadFile as a dependency
    [uploadFile]
  );

...
```

Finally, your **src/components/upload.js** should look like

```js
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';
import { useMutation } from '@apollo/react-hooks';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const UploadMutation = gql`
  mutation uploadFile($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) {
      path
      id
      filename
      mimetype
    }
  }
`;

// pass in the UploadMutation mutation we created earlier.

const FileUpload = () => {
  const [uploadFile] = useMutation(UploadMutation);

  const onDrop = useCallback(
    (acceptedFiles) => {
      // select the first file from the Array of files
      const file = acceptedFiles[0];
      // use the uploadFile variable created earlier
      uploadFile({
        // use the variables option so that you can pass in the file we got above
        variables: { file },
        onCompleted: () => {},
      });
    },
    // pass in uploadFile as a dependency
    [uploadFile],
  );

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div
        {...getRootProps()}
        className={`dropzone ${isDragActive && 'isActive'}`}
      >
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {isDragActive ? (
          <p>Drop the files here ...</p>
        ) : (
          <p>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default FileUpload;
```

![Upload example](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale/v1614284221/blog/file-upload-react/upload_g2wdsg.gif)

And thats all you need to upload files with apollo-upload-client and react.
However, You are going to run into issues when trying to display files like
images on the client side of your application but don't worry because that's
what we are going to work on next.

## BONUS 💃

Henceforth, i'm just going to give you a brief walk through on how these code
works and you can find the complete source code for both the server and client
on github.

- server
  [https://github.com/DNature/apollo-upload/tree/apollo-server-express](https://github.com/DNature/apollo-upload/tree/apollo-server-express)
- client
  [https://github.com/DNature/apollo-upload-client](https://github.com/DNature/apollo-upload-client)

<dot />

### Server

Now we are going to configure our server to be able to serve static files so we
are going to switch from the regular _apollo-server_ to _apollo-server-express_.

Install express, cors and apollo-server-express by running

```bash
npm install cors express apollo-server-express
```

> **CORS:** Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted
> resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain
> from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed
> cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. _Wikipedia_

I think this funny image explains **cors** better:

![cors meme](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnature/image/upload/c_scale,w_0.8/v1614284199/blog/file-upload-react/cors_lcu8ka.jpg)

Add the following piece of code to make your server look like this

```js {1,4,5,6,24,26,28,30}
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server-express';
import typeDefs from './typeDefs';
import resolvers from './resolvers';
import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors'; // import cors
import path from 'path';

const app = express();

// Import your database configuration
import connect from './db';

export default (async function () {
  try {
    await connect.then(() => {
      console.log('Connected 🚀 To MongoDB Successfully');
    });

    const server = new ApolloServer({
      typeDefs,
      resolvers,
    });

    const dir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'images');

    app.use('/images', express.static(dir)); // serve all files in the /images directory

    app.use(cors('*')); // All Cross-origin resource sharing from any network

    server.applyMiddleware({ app }); // apply express as a graphql middleware
    // server.listen(4000, () => {
    app.listen(4000, () => {
      console.log(`🚀 server running @ http://localhost:4000`);
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

<dot />

## Client

We are going to do two things on the client.

- Display files from the server,
- Create a new upload drop-zone that displays file preview.

Add a proxy that points to your server's domain in your _package.json_ file.

```json {4}
{
  ...

  "proxy": "http://localhost:4000/"
}
```

Our server no longer uses **apollo-server** but uses **apollo-server-express**
and the default endpoint of **apollo-server-express** is _/graphql_ so we need
to add that to our **createUploadLink** uri.

Now your `src/index.js` should look like this

```js {12}
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';

import App from './App.jsx';
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';
import { createUploadLink } from 'apollo-upload-client';
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/react-hooks';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';

const httpLink = createUploadLink({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: httpLink,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

Crate a file and name it `Uploads.js` in your **src/components** directory then
add the following code:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/react-hooks'; // import useQuery hook
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

// FilesQuery
export const FileQuery = gql`
  {
    files {
      id
      filename
      mimetype
      path
    }
  }
`;

export default function Uploads() {
  const { loading, data } = useQuery(
    FileQuery,
  ); /* useQuery returns and object with **loading, 
   data, and error** but we only care about the loading state and the data object.
   */

  if (loading) {
    // display loading when files are being loaded
    return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
  } else if (!data) {
    return <h1>No images to show</h1>;
  } else {
    return (
      <>
        <h1 className='text-center'>Recent uploads</h1>
        {data.files.map((file) => {
          console.log(file);
          return (
            file.mimetype.split('/')[0].includes('image') && (
              <div
                style={{
                  padding: 16,
                  border: '1px solid gray',
                  borderRadius: 5,
                  margin: '16px 0',
                }}
                key={file.filename}
              >
                <img
                  src={'/' + file.path}
                  /* Note the '/'. we added a slash prefix because our file path 
                  comes in this format: images/<filename>.jpg.
                  */ alt={file.filename}
                  style={{ width: '100%' }}
                />
                <p>{file.filename}</p>
              </div>
            )
          );
        })}
      </>
    );
  }
}
```

If you have files in your database then you should be able to see them in your
browser.

Create a file and name it `uploadWithPreview.js` in your **src/components**
directory then add the following piece of code

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';
import { useMutation } from '@apollo/react-hooks';
import { UploadMutation } from './upload';
import { FileQuery } from './Uploads'; // import FileQuery we created in the Uploads.js file

export default function WithPreviews(props) {
  const [file, setFile] = useState({}); // empty state that will be populated with a file object
  const [uploadFile] = useMutation(UploadMutation);

  // submit function
  const handleUpload = async () => {
    if (file) {
      uploadFile({
        variables: { file },
        refetchQueries: [{ query: FileQuery, variables: file }], // update the store after a successful upload.
      });
      setFile({}); // reset state after a successful upload
      console.log('Uploaded successfully: ', file);
    } else {
      console.log('No files to upload');
    }
  };

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    accept: 'image/*',
    onDrop: (acceptedFile) => {
      setFile(
        // convert preview string into a URL
        Object.assign(acceptedFile[0], {
          preview: URL.createObjectURL(acceptedFile[0]),
        }),
      );
    },
  });

  const thumbs = (
    <div className='thumb' key={file.name}>
      <div className='thumb-inner'>
        <img src={file.preview} className='img' alt={file.length && 'img'} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  useEffect(
    () => () => {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(file.preview);
    },
    [file],
  );

  return (
    <section className='container'>
      <div {...getRootProps({ className: 'dropzone' })}>
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        <p>Drag 'n' drop some file here, or click to select file</p>
      </div>
      <aside className='thumb-container'>
        {thumbs}
        <button
          type='submit'
          className={`button`}
          style={{ display: file && !Object.keys(file).length && 'none' }}
          onClick={handleUpload}
        >
          Upload
        </button>
      </aside>
    </section>
  );
}
```

**Congratulations if you made it to this pont 👏**

### Conclusion

Handling file upload on both **Rest and Graph APIs** are a little bit tricky.
However, with modern tools we can now upload files with lesser effort.

- We learnt how to setup a react application for uploads based on a graphql api.
- We also learnt how to configure our backend so that it can serve files to the
  client.

I hope you find this helpful.

### Happy codding 💻 🙂
